# NewsMood Trends:

- From the dataframe we can see that the news networks tend to stay completely neutral in their sentiment, with a fairly common thread of 0's for Positive / Negative and 1's for Neutral. This is backed up by the solid line across the 0 mark for the composite score scatterplot 

- While it's difficult to detect many patterns between the networks on the scatterplot, the differences are much more pronounced in the aggregate bar chart. The BBC and CBS both have significantly positive aggregates, while CNN, Fox, and NYT all hover between -0.05 to +0.05. As the BBC and CBS are general broadcast networks while the others are more specialized in current affairs, it makes sense that their twitter accounts would register as more "positive", as they likely are tweeting about popular entertainment more often than the others.

- I found it interesting that CNN was more negative than Fox News, which has cultivated a reputation for being quite antagonistic. This might be attributed to the shift in political power from the 2016 election, but I would want to see an aggregate Vader analysis of each account's tweets from this point in Obama's first term in order to really gauge that.
